                    <div class="tos_textline">1.0) Visuals should not be similar to already existing ones on the website, with one exception, that is <strong>default Null Core's menu color scheme.</strong></div>
                    <div class="tos_textline">1.1) It's highly recommended to fill all the fields when submitting a visual config. This affects the time spent reviewing the visual config.</div>
                    <div class="tos_textline">1.2) Submitted visual configs through the uploading page have a <strong>higher priority</strong> than configs sent directly to the developer / <strong><a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://t.me/ncvisualsvault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public telegram chat.</a></strong></div>
                    <div class="tos_textline">1.3) <strong>As LA/TOS of NCL says</strong> - "NCL has not reviewed all of the websites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked website.

Therefore, NVV <strong>do not welcome</strong> indecent names of visual configs or their description. This behavior can lead to <strong>suspending Your IP</strong> from using our services.</div>
                    <div class="tos_textline">1.7) When your visual config is under review, your visual config description / name might be changed <strong>without your notice</strong>. This is done to <strong>avoid your own suspension</strong> from our services. Your visual config name will be set to "NC Visual Config" without description if it was included previously. By 1.6 NVV has a right to deny or suspend any user who has submitted a visual config that includes rude / swear names / description.</div>

                    <div class="tos_textline">2.0) Any kind of attempt to bypass upload/submit system (Spamming, using scripts to automatically upload more than one visual config at the time, 3rd party web-bots, custom crawlers) will be considered as <strong>a threat to the website and it's services,</strong> resulting in Your, or, a threats <strong>IP permanently suspended</strong> from using our services. If You cannot access the website or You think You were denied / suspended from using our services was a mistake, You can always reach out NVV at <strong><a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://t.me/ncvisualsvault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telegram</a></strong>.</div>
                    <div class="tos_textline">2.1) This is not an advertising website. Unfairly trying to claim someone's visual configs or will result in a denial and in some cases - <strong>suspension.</strong></div>

If not, this will result in <strong>denial.</strong></div>
                    <div class="tos_textline">2.3) Usernames deemed inappropriate by NVV may be permanently or temporarily banned. This applies to all existing or subsequent users of the website. In some cases the blocking process may occur during the publication of a visual config resulting in the appearance of a banned user on a website page. Previously uploaded visual configs by that user will remain on the website but the user will no longer be able to upload configs under his username. In most cases this will not happen since any user who does not comply with 1.6 will be suspended from using our services. </div>

                        <div class="answer">A: You can submit your own config at <strong><a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://ncvisualsvault.cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main page</a></strong>, by clicking <strong>"Submit Visual Config"</strong></div>

                        <div class="answer">A: It's a common thing that happens when you try to import a Null Core visual config. Most of the times after restarting the game it imports just fine, however, if your game keeps crashing after couple more attempts, you should report a downloaded file from our website to our GitHub or Telegram so we could check if the file trully corrupted or not</div>

                        <div class="answer">A: Unfortunately, NVV cannot help with such scenario case. Once config is uploaded on the website, it has a right to stay under uploaders name.</div>

                    <div class="qa__content">
                        <div class="qm">Q: I submitted my visual config / mod and it still didn't appear on the website. Why?</div>
                        <div class="answer">A: To verify / upload your visual config it can take from 1 to 6 working days. If it did not appear after, You can consider it was denied. Or you can always message us <a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://t.me/ncvisualsvault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></div>

                        <div class="answer">A: As our TOS says - You can only leave your steam account. If you have uploaded your visual config under different steam account while having your visual configs submitted before, it will be updated to the latest steam URL you've given</div>

                        <div class="qm">Q: Why this website exists when I can make my own visuals and my friends have a lot of their own?</div>
                        <div class="answer">A: NVV understands that there are people who has been using Null Core for a long time. But there are also new people to that software which usually get lost when it comes to making their own visual config. It's also helpful if your account was reset or when you just want to try out other visual configs or take some of visual configs to base your own visual config on it</div>
