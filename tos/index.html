               <div class="tos_textline">1.0) Visuals should not be similar to already existing ones on the website, with one exception, that is <strong>default Null Core's menu colorscheme.</strong></div>
               <div class="tos_textline">1.1) It's highly recommended to fill all the fields when submitting a visual config. This affects the time spent reviewing the visual config.</div>
               <div class="tos_textline">1.2) Submitted visual configs through the uploading page has a <strong>higher priority</strong> than configs that has been sent directly to the dev / <strong><a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://t.me/ncvisualsvault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public telegram chat.</a></strong></div>
               <div class="tos_textline">1.3) <strong>As LA/TOS of NCL says</strong> - "NCL has not reviewed all of the websites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked website.

               <div class="tos_textline">1.7) When your visual config is under review, your visual config description / name might be changed <strong>without your notice</strong>. This is done to <strong>avoid your own suspension</strong> from our services (Your visual config name will be "NC Visual Config" without description if it was included previously). By 1.6 NVV has a right to deny or suspend any user who has submitted a visual config that includes rude / swear names / description.</div>
               <br>
               <div class="tos_textline">2.0) Any kind of attempt to bypass uploading system (Spamming, using scripts to automatically upload more than one visual config at the time, 3rd party web-bots, custom crawlers) will be considered as <strong>a threat to the website and it's services,</strong> resulting in Your, or, a threat's <strong>IP permanently suspended</strong> from using our services.

If not, this will result in <strong>denial.</strong></div>
               <div class="tos_textline">2.4) Usernames deemed dangerous or inappropriate by NVV may be permanently or temporarily banned. This applies to all existing or subsequent users of the website. In some cases the blocking process may occur during the publication of a visual config resulting in the appearance of a banned user on a website page. Previously uploaded visual configs by that user will remain on the website but the user will no longer be able to upload configs under this username. In most cases this will not happen since any user who does not comply with 2.0 will be suspended from using our services. </div>
               <br>
               <div class="tos_textline">3.0) Any kind of attempt to spam download links or abuse <strong>download counter</strong> of the visual configs may result in suspension of Yours or threats IP address.</div>

                  <div class="answer">A: NVV understands that there are people who has been using Null Core for a long time. But there are also new people to that software which usually get lost when it comes to making their own visual config.
