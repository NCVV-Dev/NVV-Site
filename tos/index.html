                        <div class="tos_textline">1.1) It is highly recommended that all fields are completed when submitting a visual config. Incomplete submissions may result in delays during the review process.</div>
                        <div class="tos_textline">1.2) Visual configurations submitted via the official upload page will receive <strong>higher priority</strong> for review compared to those sent directly to the developer or <strong><a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://t.me/ncvisualsvault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public Telegram chat.</a></strong></div>
                        <div class="tos_textline">1.3) <strong>As stated in the NCL Terms of Service:</strong> - "NCL has not reviewed all of the websites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked website. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by NCL. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk."</div>
                        <div class="tos_textline">1.4) Users who wish to include skyboxes with their visual configurations must provide links to the skyboxes in the "Additional Information" field or upload them to the public Telegram chat after submitting their configuration. Users must comply with section 2.3 when sharing links.
                        <div class="tos_textline">1.5) By clicking the <strong>"Submit"</strong> button on the submission page, users agree to provide their IP address. IP addresses are stored securely and will only be used in cases involving suspension. This policy applies exclusively to the submission page.</div>
                        <div class="tos_textline">1.6) NVV values integrity and professionalism from its users. Therefore, <strong>indecent or inappropriate names and descriptions</strong> for visual configurations are strictly prohibited. Submissions containing such content may result in the suspension of the user's IP address from accessing NVV services.</div>
                        <div class="tos_textline">1.7) During the review process, NVV reserves the right to <strong>modify the name and/or description</strong> of a submitted visual configuration without prior notification. This includes renaming the configuration to <strong>"NC Visual Config"</strong> and omitting any previously included description. Submissions violating clause <strong>1.6</strong>, including those with offensive or inappropriate names or descriptions, may be rejected, and the user's IP address may be suspended from using NVV services.</div>
                        <br>
                        <div class="tos_textline">2.0) Any attempt to bypass the upload/submit system (e.g., spamming, using scripts to upload multiple visual configs simultaneously, utilizing third-party web bots, or custom crawlers) will be considered a threat to the website and its services. Such actions will result in the permanent suspension of the responsible IP address from accessing our services. If you are unable to access the website or believe your suspension was made in error, you may contact NVV via Telegram for assistance.</div>
                        <div class="tos_textline">2.1) This is not an advertising website. Unfairly trying to claim someone's visual configs or will result in a denial and in some cases - <strong>suspension.</strong></div>
                        <div class="tos_textline">2.2) Users are permitted to include their own screenshots and skyboxes related to the game and the visuals being uploaded. These must be submitted in the <strong>"Additional Information"</strong> field using trusted resources such as GameBanana, Imgur, Pastebin, Discord, Google, or Flickr. Failure to comply will result in the denial of the submission.</div>
                        <div class="tos_textline">2.3) Usernames deemed inappropriate by NVV may result in a permanent or temporary ban. This applies to all existing and future users/uploaders on the website. In certain cases, the banning process may occur during the publication of a visual configuration, resulting in a banned username appearing on the website. Previously uploaded configurations from the banned user will remain accessible, but the user will no longer be able to submit new configurations under that username. Generally, this is avoided, as users who violate clause <strong>1.6</strong> are suspended entirely from using our services. </div>

                        <div class="tos_textline">3.0) Any attempts to spam download links or manipulate the download counter of visual configurations may result in the suspension of your IP address or the IP address responsible for the abuse.</div>

                            <div class="answer">A: Game crashes during the import of Null Core visual configs are a common occurrence. In most cases, restarting the game resolves the issue, and the configuration imports successfully. However, if your game continues to crash after multiple attempts, please report the issue along with the file details to our GitHub or Telegram. We will investigate whether the file is genuinely corrupted or if there is another issue</div>

                            <div class="answer">A: Reviewing and verifying a visual configuration can take anywhere from 1 to 6 business days. If your submission does not appear after this period, it may have been denied. For further clarification, you can contact us via Telegram or other support channels to inquire about the status of your submission.</div>

                            <div class="answer">A: NVV acknowledges that experienced users of Null Core often create their own visuals or share them with friends. However, this website is designed to assist newcomers who may find creating visual configs challenging or confusing. It also serves as a resource for those whose accounts have been reset, who wish to explore other visual configs, or who want to use existing configs as a foundation for creating their own</div>
