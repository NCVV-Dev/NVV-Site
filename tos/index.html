               <div class="pTitle">Uploading a visual config</div>
               <div class="tos_textline">1.0) Visuals should not be similar to already existing ones on the website, with some exceptions, like <strong>default Null Core's menu colorscheme.</strong></div>
               <div class="tos_textline">1.1) It's highly recommended to fill all the fields when submitting a visual config and provide as much information as possible about it. This affects the time spent reviewing the visual config.</div>
               <div class="tos_textline">1.2) Submitted visual configs through the uploading page has a <strong>higher priority</strong> than configs that has been sent directly to the dev / <strong><a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://t.me/ncvisualsvault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public telegram chat.</a></strong></div>
               <div class="tos_textline">1.3) <strong>As LA/TOS of NCL says</strong> - "NCL has not reviewed all of the websites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked website. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by NCL. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk."</div>
               <div class="tos_textline">1.4) If You (User) have skyboxes and You would like to add them with Your uploaded visual config, You must provide the skyboxes in <strong>"Additional Information"</strong> field by putting a link (You must follow the 3.0) or <strong><a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://t.me/ncvisualsvault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing in public telegram chat</a></strong> after uploading.</div>
               <div class="tos_textline">1.5) By uploading Your visual config You agree with NVV that You will <strong>provide Your IP address.</strong> Your IP address is stored privately and is used only <strong>in case of suspension.</strong> This does not apply to <strong>all pages</strong> on the website.</div>
               <div class="tos_textline">1.6) <strong>NVV appreciates</strong> the honesty and decency of a user. Therefore, NVV <strong>do not welcome</strong> indecent names of visual configs or their description. This behavior can lead to <strong>suspending Your IP</strong> from using our services.</div>
               <br>
               <div class="tos_textline">2.0) Any kind of attempt to bypass uploading system (Spamming, using scripts to automatically upload more than one visual config, 3rd party web-bots, crawlers) will be considered as <strong>a threat to the website and it's services,</strong> resulting in Your, or, a threat's <strong>IP permanently suspended</strong> from using our services. If You cannot access the website or You think You were denied/suspended from using our services was a mistake, You can always reach out NVV at <strong><a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://t.me/ncvisualsvault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telegram</a></strong>.</div>
               <div class="tos_textline">2.1) This is not an advertising site. Unfairly trying to claim someone's visual configs will result in a denial and in some cases - <strong>suspension.</strong></div>
               <div class="tos_textline">2.2) Telegram links that have been linked to groups or chats instead of user <strong>will be removed or uploaded visual config denied.</strong> Incorrect telegram links also could be restored by <strong><a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://t.me/ncvisualsvault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messaging here.</a></strong></div>
               <div class="tos_textline">2.3) If You did not message about Your telegram username being changed within 7 days since the day of uploaded visual config, it will be <strong>removed without any possible chance of restoring</strong> it.</div>
               <br>
               <div class="tos_textline">3.0) You are allowed to put own screenshots and skyboxes of the game with visuals You are uploading (or screenshots of any skybox) in "Additional Information" field, but only from trusted resources (such as Gamebanana, Imgur, Pastebin, Discord, Google, Flickr etc). If not, this will result in <strong>denial.</strong></div>
               <div class="tos_textline">3.1) You are allowed to request a <strong>removal of the content</strong> which has been uploaded to the website. This requires messaging from the telegram account which was included in information fields before. Unfortunately <strong>NVV does not cooperate with steam accounts</strong> or delete visual configs which has no known author/uploader.</div>

               <div class="qa__content">
                  <div class="qm">Q: I want to upload my visuals, how do I do it?</div>
                  <div class="answer">A: You can submit your own config at <strong><a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://ncvisualsvault.cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main page</a></strong>, by clicking <strong>"Upload Visuals"</strong></div>

                  <div class="qm">Q: My game crashes when I'm trying to load a visual config, is the file corrupted?</div>
                  <div class="answer">A: It's a common thing for Null Core cheat to happen especially when it's a visual config. Most of the times after restarting the game it loads normally, however, if it still doesn't work, you should report it to us so we could check if the file is corrupted or not</div>

               <div class="qa__content">
                  <div class="qm">Q: Someone just uploaded my own visuals without me knowing, what can I do?</div>
                  <div class="answer">A: Unfortunately, NVV cannot help. Once config is uploaded on the website, it has a right to stay under uploader's name. Unless the user who uploaded it will request a removal of content (User must follow the requirements of 3.1 of "Uploading a visual config")</div>
               </div>
               <div class="qa__content">
                  <div class="qm">Q: I submitted my visual config / mod and it still didn't appear on the website. Why?</div>
                  <div class="answer">A: To submit and verify / upload your visual config it can take from 1 to 6 days. If it did not appear even after, You can consider it was denied. Or you can always message us <a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://t.me/ncvisualsvault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></div>

               <div class="qa__content">
                  <div class="qm">Q: What contacts I can leave when I am submitting my config?</div>
                  <div class="answer">A: As our TOS says - You can leave both of your steam and telegram accounts. We suggest you to link steam account to be sure no one will claim your telegram username after you've changed it. But we also won't be able to respond to your request on removal of content since that requires your telegram account</div>

                  <div class="qm">Q: I want to know where or at what state my visual config is. Can I know such information?</div>
                  <div class="answer">A: Yes, you can. Such question can be answered at <a class="other__clickablelink" href="https://t.me/ncvisualsvault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public telegram chat</a></div>

                  <div class="qm">Q: Why this website exists when I can make my own visuals and my friends has a lot of their own?</div>
                  <div class="answer">A: NVV understands that there are people who has been using Null Core for a long time. But there are also new people to that software which usually get lost when it comes to making their own visual config. It's also helpful if your account was reset or when you just want to try out other visual configs or take some of visual configs to base your own visual config on it</div>

                  <div class="answer">A: This represents how much a person contributed to the website. Here's list of colors -
                     <div class="contributorshowcaseclass>">- For contributing to the project in any kind - <span class="contributor">Greenish color</span></div>
